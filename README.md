# Advent of Code (2021)
The Advent of Code puzzles for each day are available [here](https://adventofcode.com/2021)

## Setup
Using Kotlin 1.5.x with JDK 11 
Using the Eclipse IDE with Kotlin plugin 

- Eclipse version 2021-09 (4.21.0)
- Kotlin plugin version 0.8.22

Using Maven

### Notes
Found that Eclipse is not building the Kotlin files/classes and have to do that via the command line
	
	mvn clean test-compile
	
Not sure what is wrong with development environment setup
